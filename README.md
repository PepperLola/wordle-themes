## What is it?

Do you ever wish that the emojis Wordle provides when sharing your score were a little more interesting than the green, yellow and black squares?
Even with the high contrast mode's orange and blue ones, do you find yourself yearning for different emojis?
Well fear not, because this extension will come to the rescue.
Set your own emojis for each of the types of letters and amaze your friends when they see your custom emojis and acknowledge that you are far cooler than them.
Or at least convince them that you did not, in fact, change the emojis one by one to your own.

## Installation

You can install this extension on the [Firefox Add-ons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/wordle-themes/) or ~~on the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore)~~ (not published yet).
Simply click `Add to Firefox` or `Add to Chrome` to do so.

## How do I use it?

Now that you've installed the extension, make sure that it's pinned to your toolbar. This should happen by default, and if you can see the Wordle Themes icon next to your search bar, you don't have to worry about it.
Next, click the icon. Paste in the emojis you want to use into each of the respective text boxes. They save automatically, so you don't have to worry about that either. That's it! Carry on sharing your Wordle scores and be sure to send the custom emojis to all of your friends (and the extension too if you feel like it)!

## Planned Features

- [ ]   An emoji picker so you don't have to copy and paste them into the extension window
- [ ]   Custom colors for letters on the screen
